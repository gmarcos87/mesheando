# Projects I worked on:
_________________

## LibreMesh
[LireMesh](https://libremesh.org) is a firmware based on OpenWrt for the deployment of self-administered mesh networks, designed for the creation of community networks.
During the time I've been working on the project I mainly contributed to the coding reviewing and debugging in situ of the new features or fix made.

## LimeApp
Interface of administration and diagnostic of a router with LibreMesh. Written in Preact and with backend in Lua. The biggest challenge in [LimeApp](https://github.com/libremesh/lime-app) is that it must weigh about 100kb (the whole LibreMesh operating system must run on 4mb devices).
Currently this should go into a rewriting process, the constant feedback I have received from users gave me new ideas for this tool.

## WebPh.One
[WebPh.one](https://webph.one) an open source progressive web application that allows you to make calls to Community Cellular Networks and to each other. It is developed by SayCel and [Rhizomatica](https://www.rhizomatica.org/). I was working on the first prototype of the UI, including the WebRTC communication system.
It was originally programmed in Angual2, which was a challenge since at that time the integration of Angular2 with service workers was still a draft in a google docs.
This work was made possible thanks to a flash grant from Rhizomatica and the [Shuttleworth Foundation](https://freifunk.net/).

## SoporteRemoto
WebApp developed in React, with secure-scuttlebutt as a distributed backend for the management of tikets and support of mesh communities completely offline.
(Currently under development - [repo](https://github.com/LibreRouterOrg/soporteremoto-dashboard/))


## La Megafónica - Community Radio
The [Community Radio "La Megafónica"](https://web.archive.org/web/20160313072737/http://megafonica.org/) was established in an occupied building. It is made up of a horizontal work collective, committed to the search for a more just, egalitarian, free and humane reality. The project ended when the families of the occupation were able to access their own homes.

## DTL
It is a grassroots initiative to provide technical support to community radio and television stations in Argentina. Participated during the development of the first prototype of OpenSource digital TV transmitter. The project worked so well that it ended with the confiscation of the transmitter by the police :(

## Google Summer of Code
I've been part of the Google Summer of Code program for three years. The first two as a student and the last year as a mentor. The host organization was [Freifunk](https://freifunk.net/) (German for: "free radio"), a non-commercial open grassroots initiative to support free computer networks in the German region.

## Shared-state
[Shared-state](https://github.com/libremesh/lime-packages) is the distributed communication system that was recently implemented in LibreMesh. I worked on its development and created several plugins. I also made a JavaScript version that is interoperable with the Lua version (shared-state-js).

# Private and state sector:

During several years of my life I also worked for private and state organizations.

I worked for 5 years at the [National University of Villa María](https://www.unvm.edu.ar), where I also studied a degree in Multimedia Production. And during my time in the city of Buenos Aires I worked as a fullstack developer for [Ilcacto](https://ilcacto.com), a small multimedia development company.

In the last years I also worked as an external consultant for [Waba](https://waba.network) on the development of [Discoin](https://discoin.com.ar), a complementary currency for the promotion of regional economies.

Unfortunately, since the software is closed, nothing I did in this job is demonstrable, and it was no small thing.
